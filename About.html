  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p style="font-family: cursive; font-style: italic;"><b>Hello. My name is Maisha and I am the owner of 'Mai Whimsy World'.</b></p>

  <h2>What inspired you to create this website?</h2>
  <p style="font-family: cursive; font-style: italic;"><b>I wanted to create a website that would feel unique to me but also provide a type of third space for others as well. I'm a big fangirl at heart and a very creative person too.
    With both these in mind, I started thinking of ways I could incorperate this and bring my vision to life. I follow a lot of fandom spaces online but I realised over time how difficult 
    it is to find people with similar interests as mine from South Africa. It is very rare to find people from your home country on the internet (believe it or not) so I thought about how fun it would
    be to create a space for others that may share similar sentiments.</b></p>

  <p style="font-family: cursive; font-style: italic;"><b>I  tried to put together a few of my hobbies, ones that are common and other's not so much. After many hours switching between JSC, Google and numerous youtube tutorials I was able to create this little
    version of my own corner of the internet. A little color and whimsy (like Willy Wonka or Mary Poppins) for all to enjoy. I am still learning and one day I hope to look back on this and be more proud of where this started. I hope you enjoy being here and look forward to many more exciting 
    stuff that I may add in the future. Thank You.</b></p>
